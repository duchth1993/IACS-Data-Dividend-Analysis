## 🤔 Why Does $IACS Exist?

Most DAO tokens reward speculation or voting.  
**$IACS is different**: it rewards **sustained contribution to data science public goods**.

As stated on [omniacsdao.xyz](https://omniacsdao.xyz):  
> *“We create online training material, accessible code repositories, build machine learning models, design algorithms, provide analysis services and experiment with AI applications to help proliferate data science knowledge.”*

Their output is tangible:
- ✅ **Code repositories** & **analysis case studies**  
- ✅ **Public dashboards** & **open data applications**  
- ✅ **Model Z00**: trained ML weights for public use  
- ✅ **Data science course** on Ethereum-based examples  

→ **$IACS is the economic layer that turns this public service into shared ownership.**

## 🔍 On-Chain Insight: Who Holds $IACS?

Based on community data and token distribution principles:

| Holder Type       | Role                                  | Alignment |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------|
| Core Contributors | Builders of dashboards, models, courses | Long-term |
| Active Community  | Learners, analysts, bounty participants | Organic   |
| Treasury          | Funds future bounties & development   | Locked    |

Unlike speculative tokens, **$IACS circulates among those who *use* and *build* the ecosystem** — creating a **self-sustaining loop of value creation**.

## 💡 The Real Utility: Beyond Governance

$**IACS unlocks access to premium public goods**, including:
- 🔒 **Model Z00 weights** (for advanced classification tasks)  
- 📊 **Token-gated dashboards** with deeper analytics  
- 🧠 **Analysis templates** in R/Python for on-chain research  

This creates a **flywheel**:
1. You contribute → earn $IACS  
2. You hold $IACS → access better tools  
3. You build better → ecosystem grows → $IACS appreciates in utility  

It’s not a governance token — it’s a **membership key to the data commons**.
